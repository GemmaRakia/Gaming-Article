            Street Fighter 6 offers a new control mode to play without the need to remember difficult command inputs, allowing players to enjoy the flow of battle.
             Players who are delving into the world of Street Fighter for the first time,
             or those who haven't touched a fighting game in years, can jump right in. Of course,
             the traditional control type of the series is still available for players who enjoy it.
        </p>
    <p>The modern control type is allows new players to performe special moves and combos without memorising and practicing special move button combinations first. Classic controles
        are the the controles that have been used in every previouse steet fighter and give you full control of your charecter.
    </p>
<p>The engine that powers the Drive System is available as soon as the round begins, allowing players to fight to their liking. 
    If a player spends their entire Drive Gauge, they will enter a burnout state with big disadvantages, 
    but it also replenishes automatically, making meter management a key to the fight.
     Understanding the system in-depth, including when to be conservative and when to gamble, allows for deep, high-level battles.</p>

          World Tour is an immersive single player story mode. This is a completely new experience that defies genre labels(this is because fighting games don't usually have an open world story mode). Carve out your own custome charecter and ingage in fights on the streets! Look for more news on World Tour in the near future!</p>
