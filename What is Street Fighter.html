        <div class="texto"><p> Even though  the premise is simple, the colourful cast of characters each with their own stories(that can be seen in the game)
    and movesets that flow well with both their designs and gameplans make each match unique and interesting. In order to consistantly win matches it is
    important to pick up on your oppenants habbits early in rounds. That way you will be able to exploite them until 
    they switch up their game plan, if they are able to do so.</p></div>

        <div class="texto1"><p>There are 46 characters in SFV which means there are 46 different flavours to
            explore within a givin match. This means there is at least one character for everyone with various difficulty
            levels so that newer players can learn the basics whilst higher level players can express there skills with
            someone with a higher skill ceiling(a skill ceiling is a term used to describe how difficult it is to play 
            a charecter at their best).
