        <div class="texta"><p>Street fighter has accuired a large player base over it's inception
            other three decades ago. But what makes SFV different from the rest.</p>
            <p> SFV is the first one to
            use unreal engine which allows them to make graphical improvements to the game such as adding physics 
            to clothing and hair. This is why almost all the characters something in their design that would be impacted
            by the characters movemnts(to show of the new physics).</p>
            <p> They also added "Role Back Netcode" which has quickly become a must in modern fighting games. This is due to the fact that more tournaments are
            being held online as well as the that is also how the general playerbase chose to play the game.
            Role Back Nectcode works by recording the events of a match whilst its happening; this is done in casse of the
            event of packet loss, the game would simply go back to a previouse state in which there was no interference
            (hence the name role back).
